## Installation / Using our application

So as to use our application, you can simply go to https://lowympact.fr (preferably on your phone to have an optimal display). From here, you can use the application from your browser or install it on your phone by going to the settings of your browser (it's a Progressive Web App). You can also use our API : the documentation is located on https://api.lowympact.fr/api-docs

### Showcase 

Once you accessed our application, through a mobile web browser, or directly by downloading it, you can start scanning food products to get their informations. 

You can get the environmental impact of any food product by scanning its barcode. However, please note that environmental informations might not be available for all products, due to missing data in the public database used by the application (Open Food Facts).

In order to access traceability informations, you will need to scan a QR Code generated by us (just like the one below). These QR Codes are unique and are used to identify the traceability of a single product, starting from the origin of its ingredients. 
You can scan these QR Codes from our application, or from any qrcode scanner available on your phone.
